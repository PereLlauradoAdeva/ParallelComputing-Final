What to do• It’s possible to implement the assignments in pairs 
• 6 credits course: implement a programming assignment 
using one of the approaches presented (parallelization/
vectorization). Implement a sequential and a parallel 
version. 
• 9 credits course (or 6 credits with pair): implement a 
programming assignment using one of the approaches 
presented. Implement a sequential and a parallel version. 
• Write a tech report with performance analysis (speedup) 
and prepare a presentation 
• Keep everything on a public Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab

Image reader
• Multithread JPEG image reader 
• read X images from a directory 
• Keep the uncompressed bitmaps (or the 
compressed stream) in an appropriate data 
structure, that manages access to the images 
• OpenMP does not allow to implement a non-
blocking version since it requires asynchronous 
multi-threading (ie.. CUDA allows it).

Image resizer
• Implement a fast image scaling 
that is robust to image-scaling 
attacks (see https://scaling-
attacks.net) 
• Scaling is a basic functionality 
in computer vision systems 
based on Convolutional Neural 
Networks 
• Can use, OpenMP, 
vectorization and CUDA.

Kernel image processing

• CUDA is a very good  
candidate 
• See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)

Image composition
• Implement a parallel alpha composition of images 
• Useful to create image augmentation to train 
Convolutional Neural Networks, e.g. for detection 
(see Blend augmentation in ImgAug library) 
• Can parallelize applying the same object to 
different images, or in different positions in the 
same image

Scale space blob detection
• Detect image blobs using a scale space approach 
to recognize them at different scales 
• It’s possible to use Lowe’s algorithm (proposed in 
the SIFT descriptor), based on differences of 
Gaussians (DoG)

Histogram equalization• Histogram equalization is a digital image processing 
method by which you can calibrate the contrast using 
the image histogram. 
• This method usually increases the overall contrast of 
many images, especially when the usable image data 
is represented by very close contrast values. Through 
this adaptation, the intensities can be better distributed 
on the histogram.

Integral image
• An integral image is obtained accumulating the values of the pixels along x 
and y axis. 
• Eg. The value of the pixel at (2,1) coordinates is computed from the sum of 
the pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (1,2) coordinates … 
• It’ often used to compute visual features with a reduced computational cost 
(eg. Mean values of parts of the image, used in Viola&Jones detector or 
also in more modern CNN-based features based on NetVLAD).

LBP Descriptor• Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple and powerful texture 
descriptor. It assigns to each pixel a binary value which is 
obtained by comparing the value of the surrounding pixels 
and binarizing the difference with respect to the pixel itself.

Bigrams / trigrams
• Compute histograms of bigrams/trigrams on texts 
(eg. Wikipedia / Gutenberg project documents) 
• Consider bigrams/trigrams of characters and 
words 
• If needed re-use more and more times the 
collected data to create a large enough corpus

Password decryption
• Decrypt passwords encrypted using crypt (DES) 
• Consider 8 characters lengths in the set [a-zA-Z0-9./] 
• CUDA does not provide the crypt C-library function. 
Must use a special implementation (check Moodle) 
• It’s a (slowed down) search problem. 
• Can choose to attack a specific password in a list (in 
different positions), or decrypt a full list of passwords (in 
this case reduce the search space) 
• Can consider only dates or common 8-chars passwords

of time series

Mean shift clustering
• Implement a parallel version of mean-shift clustering.

of desired clusters (it uses KDE, so needs a 
bandwidth parameter) but its complexity is O(N2)

Bloom filter
• The Bloom filter is a probabilistic and memory 
efficient structure that is used to test whether an 
element is part of a set or not. 
• If the filter says no, it is sure that the element is not 
part of it ("definitely not in set"), in the case of a yes 
this may not actually be part of it ("possibly in set”)
